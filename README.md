# userscripts
Some of the userscripts I make/have made to make my life easier.

Feel free to use them obviously.

## Table of Contents

### eBayShippingCalculator.js
A script that will add the shipping price to the main price so you can better tell at a glance whether a price is good or not.
Works on multiple places eBay displays lists of items (search pages, seller item lists, etc.)
